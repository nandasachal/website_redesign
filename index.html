                        <p>Our team created a gamified version of Quill's current single-player
                           game called WordLike. <a href="https://www.quill.org/">Quill</a> is a 
                           nonprofit that is striving to make students better writers. Our gamified
                           approach was founded in capitalizing on human nature's affinity towards
                           cooperation and competition. Check out the application <a href="http://wordlike-playground.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.

                        <p>Our team created a prototype of an IoT helper application that 
                           simplifies the process of choosing clothes given occasion, weather, what's 
                           in the laundry, and other variables. The app aims to reduce the inefficiencies 
                           associated with managing one's closet, which can often take up to 15 minutes 
                           daily. Check out the repository <a href="https://github.com/nandasachal/SomeWear_Prototype">

                        <p>Our team created solution that centralizes information updates from
                           multiple sources at Box. The incentive behind this product was 
                           based on the fact that Box was no longer a small startup with a few
                           employees, and efficient communication to all employees needed to
                           be optimized. The solution cannot be shared since it is Box internal property.
